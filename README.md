# Props Color Finder

**Props Color Finder** is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help users find the closest color match from the [Open Props color palette](https://open-props.style/#colors), match [CSS's built-in named colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color), and convert colors to the [OKLCH color space](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/access-colors-spaces#oklch).

## Key Features

### **1. Open Props Colors (Core Palette)**

- Discover the closest match to any input color in the **Open Props** paletteâ€”a collection of modern colors optimized for UI development.

### **2. Named CSS Colors**

- Quickly find a match among CSS's built-in named colors, providing browser-safe options for web projects.

### **3. HDR (OKLCH) Color Support**

- Convert any color to its **OKLCH** representation with rounded values, ideal for high-dynamic-range workflows.

### **4. Perceptual Color Matching Mode (LAB)**

- By default, the app uses **RGB** for color matching.  
  You can switch to **LAB color space** for perceptual matching:
  - Toggle the checkbox labeled **"Enable LAB Color Matching"**.  
    When enabled, LAB color space ensures closer alignment with human visual perception.

## How to Use

### 1. Choose a Core Palette

- Use the dropdown menu to select:
  - **Open Props**: Find matches within the Open Props color palette (default).
  - **Named CSS**: Match against CSS's built-in named colors.
  - **HDR (OKLCH)**: Convert colors to OKLCH color space.

### 2. Pick a Color

- Use the color picker to select a color.
- The app will display the closest match or the OKLCH conversion based on your selected palette.

### 3. Enable LAB Matching (Optional)

- Toggle the **"Enable LAB Color Matching"** checkbox to switch to LAB color space for perceptual matching.
  - Example:
    - In **RGB**, red `#FF0000` maps to **red-8** (Open Props).
    - In **LAB**, the same red maps to **orange-9**, reflecting human visual perception of brightness and saturation.
